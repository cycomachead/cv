    \item[CS10] \textit{The Beauty and Joy of Computing} is a non-majors introduction to computer science. This is a hands-on project-based course taught using \snap and Python.  (4 units) % I contribute to the infrastructure and externally facing curriculum even not teaching.
    \item[CS88 / DATA C88C] \textit{Computational Structures for Data Science} is a CS1 or "1.5" course for data science majors. It is based on the venerable SICP book, taught in Python. (3 units)

    \item[CS169] \textit{Engineering Software as a Service} The original software engineering course, later split into CS169A and CS169L. (4 units)
    
    \item[CS169A] \textit{Engineering Software as a Service} is an upper division course which focuses on the dynamics of modern software engineering through RESTful design, HTTP, and team projects. (4 units)
    
    \item[CS169L] \textit{Software Engineering Team Project} is a follow up CS169L, where teams of students get hands-on experience building a semester-long project for a campus organization or local nonprofit.  (4 units)
    
    \item[CSW186] \textit{Introduction to Databases} is an upper division databases course, offered in an online format.  (4 units)
    % \item[CS194-26] 
    \item[CS195 / CSH195] \textit{The Social Implications of Computing Technology} is a course for students to explore the unintended consequences of computing, including the culture of how we build programs. H195 is an honors course where students complete a small research project. (1 unit / 3 units)
    
    \item[CS294-188] \textit{Design and Evaluation of CS at Scale} is a pedagogy course for TAs designed to engage in course-course collaborations and learn about current computing education pedagogy.  (1 unit)
    \item[CS302] \textit{Designing Computer Science Education} is a course which students take to prepare them to be the instructor of record for a summer CS course. (3 units)
    
    \item[CS375] \textit{Teaching Practicum} is the course all first time teaching assistants in computer science take. (2 units)
