    \item \textbf{Computer Science Education}
    \newline
    \small I am most experienced in high school, CS0 and CS1 courses. I am particularly interested in exploring and improving structural issues in courses, such as sound principles for course policies, teaching with teams and effective use of education technology.
    
    \item \textbf{Digital Accessibility}
    \newline
    \small I have experience building tools for software teams to improve the accessibility of web applications. I'm interested in improving methods for automatically detecting accessibility defects and recommending corrections. I am also interested in building accessible CS courses, and materials to teach accessibility to students.
